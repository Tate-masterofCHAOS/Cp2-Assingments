# Tate Morgan Financial calculator 
# This is my financial calculator

# My job is to build a prpgram that completes the following functions
# How long it will take to save for a goal based on a weekly or monthly deposit
# Compound Interest Calculator 
# Budget Allocator (use set percentages to divide an income into spending categories like savings, entertainment, and food)
# Sale Price Calculator (apply discounts to prices)
# Tip Calculator

# The Steps ill follow are as follows
# Create a main function that will run the user interface
# Using project decomposition to figure out what other functions you need and how they interact with each other
# Create your functions
# Have at least 2 people test your code to make sure it works
